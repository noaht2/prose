# My Programming Language: Prose

Prose is a programming language I’m working on implemented in Python.
It is a dialect of Lisp.

## Basics

The fundamental data structure of Prose is the list. A list is written like this: `[a b c]`.
Code is also in lists – instead of `1+2`, you write `["+", "1", "2"]`.

Functions are not a core feature.
Instead, operators act on the code passed to them directly.
